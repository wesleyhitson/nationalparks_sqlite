Generate a SQLite database from a CSV of all US National Park units. This list is current as of November '24.

You can also just download the CSV if you'd like to work with that and generate your own database. And make sure I'm not going to hack you or something.

If you'd like to read how I made this, including instructions on how to get updated/recent data from the National Parks APIs, I wrote about it on [my website](https://wesleyhitson.com/posts/).
